                I am a passionate web developer with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I have a strong interest in creating interactive and user-friendly web applications. My journey into web development started when I completed a 6-month web development course focused on React, where I gained valuable skills in building modern and responsive websites.
